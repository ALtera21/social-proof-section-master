## Overview

This one is like a walk on the park, quite easy, perfect for sunday coding, no stress, still, i did it in 4 hours

## My process

This time, i used mobile first, because i thought that at least with that, all my flex items are aligned, and when i did the desktop version, all my flex items won't scatter everywhere, i learned this the hard way after i did the testimonial grid challenge using desktop first, it was a madness.

the rest just like usual, layout first, set the size, width, height and all that, then i add the color

### Built with

- div is still better
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- no framework, no library

### What I learned

backgroud imagecan be stacked o top of each other

### Continued development

There are parts of the image where it need to used stars 5 times, i would like to learn about how to simplify it more, if there is a way that is.

### Useful resources

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I think everyone should know how to use this website, it is like wikipedia made only for coding
- [getcssscan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - i used this website to copypaste the shadow style
